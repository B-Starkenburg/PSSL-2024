This is the second (and final) announcement for the 109th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic (PSSL 109). It will be hosted in the heart of Leiden, the Netherlands, over the weekend of November 15th-17th. In-person attendance is encouraged, but it is also possible to attend virtually so that those who are unable to travel can also participate. We gather a few highlights below. Additional details can be found on the PSSL 109 website:

Submitting proposals for contributed talks:
We seek proposals for contributed talks on all aspects of category theory and its applications. Talks about work in progress are also warmly welcomed. We especially encourage PhD students and young researchers to submit their work. As PSSL is an informal gathering, there will be no formal proceedings. In order to submit a talk, please send a pdf (max. 1 A4 page) containing the details of your proposal (title, speaker name, abstract) to Chase Ford before 01 November:

We have two invited talks from Paolo Perrone (University of Oxford) and Maaike Zwart (IT University of Copenhagen).
