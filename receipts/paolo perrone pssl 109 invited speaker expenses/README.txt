To whom it may concern,

Here are my receipts for my trip to Leiden for PSSL as an invited speaker. 

I am claiming:

- EuroStar ticket, round trip, from London to Rotterdam, 188 GBP (about 225 EUR). 
  (Note that that the receipt also contains the train ticket for my partner. I only want to claim my half.)

- Train tickets from Rotterdam to Leiden and back, 17.40 EUR.

- Hotel invoice for one room, four nights, 435.14 EUR.
  (They did not charge extra for the extra person, and I am not claiming the breakfast.)

TOTAL: 677.54 EUR.
